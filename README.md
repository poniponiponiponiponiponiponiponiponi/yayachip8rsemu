Yet another `yet another chip8 rust emulator` that I created to play around
with rust, get the basic file structure right for my future rust projects, etc.
If you're writing a chip8 emulator for yourself this project might be useful
for you to compare it with your own when you will come across a bug or
something, especially since I put a lot of weight on having good disassembly,
debugging, etc.
